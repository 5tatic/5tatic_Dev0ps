BIO:\
	I have been adament about technology since I can remember. One of my earliest memories was, stumbling up safe-mode when trying to figure out how to get onto my dads computer. (This was back when safe mode allowed you to become admin and remove-change passwords on user accounts).\
 	Since then, I have had an incessant need to know everything about anything inovlving technology.
  	I have taught myself most of the skills I have, I don't believe that School is the correct setting to learn things effectly for everyone. It may work for some, but I believe in a more hands on approach. Learn by doing. 
  	I have held many jobs in my lifetime, mostly in the food industry. That all ended when I had the oportunity to work with "Lucid Motors Ltd." in thier infancy. I started as a quality control inspector, and quickly was moved over to the tech side of things. There they had me programming car components on luxery EV automobiles. That was truly an amazing learning experiance.
