Project (I.D.E.A.)
IDEA is a platform for,{
	Identifying,
	Documenting,
	Enumeration,
	Analasys,
},

This will be geared toward those wishing for an assist when it comes to securing their home netowrk and services. 
let's start by explaining how we go about that. 

1. Identifying: 
	Identifying what you're tyring to protect is a requirement in safety & security. That why we FIRMLY believe that your tools should be able to see it all (even the hidden stuff) 
	So we have built a platform with that in mind. who can defend/protect agains an Unknown-unknown? 

Features include The ability to detect any and all, {
	Signals,
	devices,
	Networks, 
	Etc,
}

2. Documenting: 
	It is important to keep a record of what you do with this program, as being "Hackerman" sounds cool, it's also HIGHLY Illegal. 
	This is why we are intigrating a robust set of recording & report generating tools, so the User can "CYA"(cover your ***). 
		
Tools include, {
	CSV sheet Generation,
	PDF Generation,
	.txt Generation,
}
			
3. Enumeration: 
	When defending a network, workgroup, or even just a cell phone we belive that if you don't have all the information about what is on your network, then you can't protect it all.
	We want to provide you with a set of tools you understand, no more are the days when only the geeks & gamers get to understand Tech Wizardry.
	To "enumerate" is just a fancy word for finding a devices UID (Unique ID). 
	Every device that sends, or recieves any kind of signals is required to have a UID. Which Is usually a long technical string of some combination of, letters, numbers, symbols. 
	The aim is to make it easy to understand, and/or rename ALL of it. To something that is more User focused. 

Tools available, {
	Dubber 1,(renaming utility)
	DB-me, (database utility for storing your Chosen Naming conventions)
},

4. Analasys: 
	The Ability to to make informed decisions about how to keep a secure network/deivce/etc, depends on how effective you are at knowing what your data is doing. 
	How do we know a bottleneck in a system isn't because someone is robbing you of system resources? Well it would be a combination of various techniques listed above. It maybe that a Nefarious actor is in your system, 
or it could just be that you have a piece of outdated equipment, that isn't working well with others. 
	That being the case, we firmly stand by Open-Source technologies, and aim to coloaborate with professionals in the data security field to keep our platform safe, effective, and User friendly.
